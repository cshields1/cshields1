Hello! I'm Craig, a musician-turned-web-developer based in Orange County, CA. I spent 10+ years primarily as an improviser making music for dance (technique classes and choreographic pieces) and playing in the Latin alt-folk band Cuñao. Now, I make websites (mainly with React/Next.js) and enjoy it just as creatively. Currently working with a small, kick-ass team contracted to a digital agency in LA.
